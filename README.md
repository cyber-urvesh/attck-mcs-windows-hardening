# MITRE ATT&CK Mappings to MS Compliance Toolkit

This project is just created for learning and personal preferences. In this project I have utilized the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit v1.0 to understand various benchmarks provided for Windows Hardening. I have mapped those benchmarks with associated MITRE ATT&CK Tactic that an adversary may be able to achieve.
